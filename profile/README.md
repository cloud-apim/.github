## Cloud APIM

Cloud APIM is a company rooted in open-source software culture and is heavily based on open-source projects. It's founders are long time open-source users, contributors and patrons. Otoroshi itself is an open-source project under Apache 2 licence and Cloud APIM is by far the biggest contributor on the project. Actually, the creator of Otoroshi is one of the founders of Cloud APIM and still pushes code on the Otoroshi repository.

As Cloud APIM is building a lot of tools around Otoroshi, we will try to give back to the community as soon as possible by making those tools available to everyone on our Github organization and continuing to contribute and lead the Otoroshi project forward.
